Compability issue
-No expertise on severless development

Solution: 
Hire personnel that;

-Manages the architectural software and applications of the system by amplifying/optimizing processes cost-effectively

-Ensure integration and configuration where apt testing is done properly before going into production

-Set up good monitoring tools that enhance and uphold the severless applications

-Lastly to ensure the security is fool-proof
   -Eg: By configuring the correct permissions in different AWS services
   -Encrypting data 
   -Third-party connections to be enabled over a secure connection



Vendor Lock-in

-Locked in on vendor X but vendor Y has better technology suited for the company


Solution: 

-Find out where the lock-in applies such as vendor-specific managed serrvices

-Compare the differences/similarities between vendors and find out the gaps of services needed for the company

-The cost of switching vendors needs to be weigh in before porting over

-Find out overhead costs and oppurtunities missed in a severless approach due to fear of lock-in





Processes & Policies

-The configured security policies is not identical to the policies architecture in the cloud hence making migration tough for the IT operations team to the cloud


Solution:

-Conduct a thorough assessment of your current security policies and compare them with best practices and standards for cloud environments (e.g., AWS Well-Architected Framework, Azure Security Best Practices)

-Identify gaps and differences between your current policies and what is recommended or required for cloud deployments

-Provide training and education to IT operations teams on cloud security principles, practices, and tools

-Continuous monitoring and improvement; where communication is key throughout the migration process, where the IT team is updated and inputting to feedback if there are better ways to smoothen the migration

-Engagement with Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)
 -Understand the shared responsibility of the CSPs and how it applies to security 
 -Leverage their secrutiy services and features to enhance your security posture such as cloud-native security controls and compliance certifications.
